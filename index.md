## Research Interests

My area of expertise is mathematical modelling in the context of health
sciences; my aim is to use my computational and mathematical skills to
improve quality of life.
Specifically:

<div class="lcol">
<p class="colname">Epidemiology</p>
<p class="colitem"><a href="portfolio/research.html#epi">more
details</a></p>
</div>

Early detection and subsequent forecasting of infectious disease epidemics
through the use of Bayesian estimation and mechanistic models of infection.
Mathematical modelling of containment strategies for epidemic diseases within
logistical constraints of existing healthcare systems, of medical and
immunological control of viral infections, and of in-host viral mutation as a
result of selection pressure.

The goals of this work are to understand and account for the real-world
constraints that limit a government's ability to identify an extant epidemic
and intervene appropriately, and to reduce endemic burden.
The outcomes of this work are to inform health-care policy on the grounds that
what is good for the population is good for the country.

<div class="lcol">
<p class="colname">Physiology</p>
<p class="colitem"><a href="portfolio/research.html#renal">more
details</a></p>
</div>

Mathematical modelling of renal physiology, working towards steady-state and
transient models of whole-organ function (e.g., water and sodium excretion) as
regulated by
[neurohormonal feedback](http://www.handwrittentutorials.com/videos.php?id=42)
under physiological and pathological states, and in response to
pharmacological interventions.
See these [interactive plots](model/rfc/) that compare model excretion rates
against data from studies of acute pressure natriuresis in the rat.

There are many potential applications, from teaching medical students to
assisting doctors with diagnoses and delivering personalised health-care.
This is of particular interest due to the ever-increasing burden of
kidney-related diseases such as essential hypertension and diabetes.

<div class="lcol">
<p class="colname">Methodology</p>
<p class="colitem"><a href="portfolio/research.html#pub">more

<p class="colitem"><a href="tools">tools</a></p>
</div>

Modelling involves more than simply creating a model and analysing its
behaviour; for a model to be <em>useful</em> to an audience beyond the
author(s) it must be documented in a thorough and precise manner, so that an
independent reader can replicate the model results (and potentially extend the
model itself).

## Portfolio

<div class="lcol">
<p class="colname">Curriculum Vit&aelig;</p>
</div>

My curriculum vitæ is available as a
[PDF document](portfolio/cv_online.pdf); please contact me directly
to request reference contact details.
I also maintain a list of [my publications](pubs).

<div class="lcol">
<p class="colname">Teaching</p>
<p class="colitem"><a href="portfolio/teaching.html">statement</a> /
<a href="portfolio/teaching.pdf">pdf</a></p>
</div>

My enthusiasm for teaching is driven by a desire to see students gain a deep
appreciation for the implications, subtleties and applications of the subject
material, since it is precisely these aspects that are not evident to the
novice student and which can inspire enthusiasm and interest.

<div class="lcol">
<p class="colname">Research</p>
<p class="colitem"><a href="portfolio/research.html">statement</a> /
<a href="portfolio/research.pdf">pdf</a></p>
</div>

I am devoted to using my mathematical and computational skills to develop
mathematical models for use in a variety of health-care contexts.
My goal is that this work will (eventually) lead to an improved quality of
life.

<div class="lcol">
<p class="colname">Writing Advice</p>
<p class="colitem"><a href="writing">useful links</a></p>
</div>

It isn't easy to write a great CV/cover letter/research statement/teaching
statement.
Thankfully many people and institutions have posted articles, samples,
templates and checklists to help the inexperienced researcher.
If anything, the problem is perhaps that there is too much advice.
Either way, I have a list of articles that I found useful.
