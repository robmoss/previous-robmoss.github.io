## Hormonal regulation of salt and water excretion

This whole-kidney model predicts steady-state salt and water excretion rates
in response to renal pressure and circulating hormone levels, as illustrated
in these [interactive plots](./rfc/).

## Afferent arteriole autoregulation

[This model](./aa-autoreg) extends an existing autoregulatory model with the
addition of an explicit glomerular capillary bed, in order to predict the
glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
