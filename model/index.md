## Hormonal regulation of salt and water excretion

This whole-kidney model predicts steady-state salt and water excretion rates
in response to renal pressure and circulating hormone levels, as illustrated
in these [interactive plots](./rfc/).

The model source code is available
[here](http://hub.darcs.net/rgm/kidney_2013-10-09).
This repository includes parameter sets and solutions for every simulation
presented in the
[accompanying manuscript](http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00089.2013), as
well as scripts that reproduce the manuscript figures.
